## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.


## Learning Goals

* Build up a working knowledge of CSS and HTML
* Continue to develop familiarity with JavaScript functionality
* Learn how to build out a comp

## Challenges

This project was very challenging for me due to my inexperience with CSS. The most difficult obstacle I faced was learning various properties, how they interact on HTML elements, and which ones would give me the styling that I needed in order to mimic the comp. The majority of my time was spent on independent research and trial-and-error implementation.

## Wins

The javascript portion of this project came more naturally to me this time around, since I had plenty of time to learn from our past paired project. Selecting HTML elements and researching how to create and manipulate the radio buttons took relatively no time at all. I consider this a win!

## Future Additions

Future additions (that I will likely take up myself soon) include building out one or more of the Choose Your Own Adventure options outlined in the project spec. This includes:

### Entire Meal Functionality
  * When the user selects the “Entire Meal” option and then clicks the “Let’s Cook!” button, the user sees a message with a side, main and dessert option from the lists of possible dishes for all categories

  * When the meal items appear, the cookpot icon disappears

### Error Handling and Clear Button
  * The user can click a clear button, which clears the page of any message. User should only be able to click the clear button if a food is visible. When the clear button is clicked and the food is removed, the image of the cookpot should re-appear.

  * User should not be able to click the “Let’s Cook” button for a recipe unless they have selected an option.
  
### User can favorite a recipe
  * When a recipe appears, it should appear with a “Favorite” button.
  
  * When the “Favorite” button is clicked, that recipe should be added to a new list of favorite recipes.

  * Users should be able to view their favorites by clicking a “View Favorites” button that exists somewhere on the page

  * When the “View Favorites” button is clicked, users should be taken to a new page that displays all of their favorite recipes.

  * Users should be able to navigate back to the main page by clicking a button.

  * Users should be able to remove a recipe from their list of favorites, by clicking a button.

  * As you add these new elements to the page, be sure to match the style of existing elements.
  
### Login Page
  * Refactor your application so that the user lands on a “Login” page

  * The login page should match the style of the application.

  * The login page should contain an input for a user to enter their name, and a button to submit.

  * After the user clicks the submit button, they should be taken to the main application page, and see a personalized greeting that displays their name and some sort of welcome message.

  * The welcome message and name should appear in a logical place of your choosing.
